### Hi, I'm Edward 👋 🙂

I'm a self-taught web developer who is passionate about learning web development. I find it more and more exciting with every new application I deliver. Some technologies I enjoy working with include GSAP, PWA, JavaScript, APIs, Firebase and CSS. 

I'm a versatile developer with interests in frontend as well as backend technologies. Adaptable and self-motivated learner. Interested in new programming technologies, and continuous self-improvement.
