### Hi, I'm Edward 👋 🙂

I'm a frontend web developer who has a lifelong passion for the tech industry. Be it websites, apps, games, desktop applications; my long-term goal is to be a strong full-stack developer.

I predominantly work with HTML, CSS and JavaScript, but I am widening my skill set on a daily basis. The most recent library I have begun learning is React.js.
